The focal point of this study is to investigate the relationship between a range of explanatory variables and house prices in California and to predict the housing prices using suitable machine learning. 

Over the last past decades, housing markets as an area of interest has long drawn attention given the causes and consequences of macroeconomics events as the great financial crash, drivers (for instance, labour, capital and material markets), but also for
microeconomic theories (e.g. consumer decision analysis) and urban planning studies (e.g. migration and mobility).

For this task, two machine learning algorithms have been applied: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor using the library Scikit-Learn. 

The goal is to develop an accurate model that can be used to estimate median house values given features retrieved from public
online listings as number of rooms, median income, median house age and so on.

The data set comprises a sample data set provided by StatLib repository derived from the 1990 U.S. census. The data uses one row per census block group which is the smallest geographical unit for which the U.S. Census Bureau publishes sample data. 

In total, 20.640 block groups are reported.
