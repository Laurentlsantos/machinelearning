Machine Learning for House Price Prediction

2. 1 Introduction
The focal point of this study is to investigate the relationship between a range of explanatory
variables and house prices in California and to predict the housing prices using suitable
machine learning. Over the last past decades, housing markets as an area of interest has long
drawn attention given the causes and consequences of macroeconomics events as the great
financial crash, drivers (for instance, labour, capital and material markets), but also for
microeconomic theories (e.g. consumer decision analysis) and urban planning studies (e.g.
migration and mobility).

For this task, two machine learning algorithms have been applied: Linear Regression and
Random Forest Regressor using the library Scikit-Learn2

. The goal is to develop an accurate
model that can be used to estimate median house values given features retrieved from public
online listings as number of rooms, median income, median house age and so on.
